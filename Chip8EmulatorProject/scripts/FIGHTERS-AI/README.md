Created using OCTO and exported as a .ch8 file. It was then tested using our own emulator, as well as Octo.

<p>Finished version of our original game, Space Fighters (vs. AI). It is a game inspired by Outlaw and Space Invaders. The game initializes at a start screen, user can press any key to begin the game. The goal is to overcome the opponent, by shooting through the asteroids that are blocking the center. Both sides can angle their shots, which can bounce off of walls. Player 1 can only move horizontally; however, the AI can also move vertically to add a layer of difficulty.</p>

FINISHED FEATURES
- title screen
- drawing initial state of alien and ship
- Player 1 inputs (A and D) for ship to move left/right, S to shoot
- AI properly moves in all directions (random pattern, different each time)
- Shots can be angled
- Bullets bounce off of walls
- Victory/Defeat screens. User is expected to reset the emulator to play again.

KNOWN BUGS
- Bullet collisions

<p>The AI for this game was programmed using this guide (https://github.com/JohnEarnest/Octo/blob/gh-pages/docs/IntermediateGuide.md) as a reference.</p>
