Created using OCTO and exported as a .ch8 file.

A prototype version of PONG. The left paddle is moved by pressing 1 for up and Q for down. Similarly,
the right paddle is moved by pressing 3 for up and E for down. This version of the prototype has 
border collisions programmed; if a ball hits the top or bottom, it will ricochet. The ball can be changed
to move up or down by using the S and X keys respectively. This can be used to test the border collisions.
Furthermore, the score tracking system has not be implemented yet, and once the ball goes out of bounds 
there is a slight delay before the game is reset.

- drawing gamestate (borders, score, paddles, ball)
- user input for left and right paddles
- basic ball movement (bounces off walls, resets the game if it goes out of bounds)

PLANNED FEATURES
- ball collision with paddles
- score tracking and updating
- option for the 2nd paddle to be controlled by a computer (tentative)
