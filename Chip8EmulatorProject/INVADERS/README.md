Created using OCTO and exported as a .ch8 file. It was then tested using a pre existing emulator.

A prototype version of SPACE INVADERS. The program starts at a title screen, the user is expected to press any CHIP-8 keyboard button to start the game. The player can move the tank at the bottom using A and D to move left and right respectively. The tank can not wrap around the screen, much like the actual game. Furthermore, the player can press E to shoot. As of right now, aliens do not die when they come in contact with the bullet (will be completed by the final version). The current prototype only implements round one; final game will have 2 more levels which will be harder, and they will all have to be beaten in order for the player to "win" the game. **If the aliens get too close, the game ends**.

FINISHED FEATURES
- title screen
- drawing initial state of aliens and tank
- user input (A and D) for tank movement to the right and left
- user input (E) to fire bullet
- aliens now have a movement pattern
- game ends when aliens get too close

PLANNED FEATURES
- killing aliens when bullet hits them
- adding two more levels with more aliens
  - transition screens between levels
- sound when aliens die
