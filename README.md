# HOW TO RUN THE TESTS AND GAMES
- Open the "testPage.html" file found in /Chip8EmulatorProject
  - results are printed in a list
  - every opcode has a test program; however, the input opcodes must be tested manually as they require user input (test them using our games)
  - different opcodes can also be inputted into test.js in order to test our emulator manually
  - if the test passes, the webpage displays the result along with the name of the opcode
  - the display opcode can be seen in motion when programs are loaded
- The visualizer can be manually tested
  - the execution of the program can be paused using the "Toggle Pause" button
  - can be stepped forward using "next"
  - the contents of the registers, stack, and memory can be seen as they update throughout the program
  - the instructions can also be seen as they are executed
  - cycle speed can be manually changed to aid in debugging
- The README files for all CHIP-8 apps contain a link to Octo, where they can be tested; furthermore, they can be tested using our own emulator
- The game dropdown menu has a list of preloaded games, and users can also upload their own games to play as well
